## 🧩 Technical Overview

CloudBeatz is a **cross-platform Flutter app** supporting **Android, Windows, and Linux**, designed for music playback, streaming, and playlist management.

Built with packages such as:
- `just_audio` – for core music playback  
- `media_kit` – for desktop audio support  
- `audio_service` – background audio management  
- `get` – for efficient state management  
- `youtube_explode_dart` – for streaming links  
- `hive` / `hive_flutter` – for local database storage  

### 🏛️ Architecture Details
- **State Management:** Powered by `GetX` for reactive state updates, easy dependency injection (`Get.put()`, `Get.find()`), and clean separation of UI from business logic.
- **Offline Storage:** Utilizing `Hive` boxes to store user preferences, search history, cached track info, and custom offline playlists efficiently with minimal overhead.
- **Audio Layer:** Integrates `just_audio` on mobile and `media_kit` on desktop through a unified background-capable `audio_service` implementation to guarantee a seamless listening experience.

### 🎨 Dynamic Theming & Customization
- **Dynamic Accent Colors:** Extract dominant colors from current album/song artwork to dynamically adjust the application theme and player background.
- **AMOLED Dark Mode:** Sleek dark mode design optimized for low-light environments and battery saving on OLED screens.
- **Adaptive Layouts:** Seamlessly adapts navigation patterns between a bottom navigation bar for mobile and a side navigation rail for desktop/tablet screens.
